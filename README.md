# Blockchain-Powered Medical Trial Registry

## 📌 Project Description
The **Blockchain-Powered Medical Trial Registry** is a decentralized platform designed to register, store, and track medical trials securely on the blockchain. By leveraging Ethereum’s immutability and transparency, the system ensures trustworthy and tamper-proof medical trial information accessible to researchers, regulators, and the public.

## 🎯 Project Vision
To create a transparent, verifiable, and corruption-resistant medical research ecosystem where clinical trials can be publicly audited and trusted across global health institutions.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Register Medical Trials:**  
  Researchers can record essential trial data on-chain, including title, description, and phase.

- **Update Trial Status:**  
  Trial creators can update status (e.g., Ongoing, Completed, Terminated).

- **Public Verifiability:**  
  Anyone can access trial data, ensuring transparency and trust.

- **Tamper-Proof Records:**  
  Once recorded, trial data cannot be altered or deleted.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Role-based access and permissions (regulators, researchers, hospitals).
- Integration with decentralized storage (IPFS/Filecoin) for full data records.
- Advanced analytics dashboard for trial discovery.
- Identity verification using blockchain-based credentials.
- Multi-chain deployment for wider accessibility and scalability.
